I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in starting with the Kratky Method of gardening. The idea is to grow lettuce in mason jars and see how growing without soil does. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously enjoyed growing my own alfalfa micro-greens, so this is the next obvious step.
Attempt #1 These didn&amp;rsquo;t go so good. I had planted some seedlings in Rockwool, and left them in a container out in the sun to act as a mini-greenhouse.</description></item></channel></rss>
