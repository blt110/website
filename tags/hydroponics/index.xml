My plan is to build an NFT hydroponic system for the yard, and dutch bucket for tomatoes.
From my light study I found the fence and some areas that may make some good light.
I found https://university.upstartfarmers.com/blog/sizing-a-pump-hydroponics-aquaponics that describes NFT Hydroponics is 4-6 GPH required for my pump. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with one trough, but plan on scaling this up to 3 if it works, so will require 18GPH of total flow.</description></item></channel></rss>
