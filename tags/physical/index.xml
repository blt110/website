With COVID, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working from home for almost two years now, and sharing a desk at times things felt a little cramped (especially with the occsional electronics project)
I&amp;rsquo;m no expert in woodwork, so decided to 3D model it before building the desk. This also helped as my Father, who&amp;rsquo;s a carpender could give me tips on a shared screen.</description></item></channel></rss>
