From previous posts you might know I’ve build my OpenIndiana ZFS FileServer. Well, just created a volume and decided to put 300GB to good use to create a time machine on my mac. There is a brilliant guide on how to do it here and suggest you all take a look (Thanks for the awesome guide Marco).</description></item><item><title>Allowing access through NFS &amp; SAMBA</title><link>https://www.scottyob.com/2011/04/04/allowing-access-through-nfs-samba/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2011 11:53:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottyob.com/2011/04/04/allowing-access-through-nfs-samba/</guid><description>Cifs Share CIFS (Common Internet File System), the protocol windows users for all it’s ‘windows file sharing’ is the method I’ll allow for my desktops and roaming computers to access files on the file server.
Before we begin, Make sure we install the CIFS kernal modules

In part 1 of this blog post, I showed you how I created a script that would, when run, rotate your snapshots on a ZFS filesystem. For this to be usable, we need to create a mechanism for having it be automatically ran.</description></item><item><title>3.

Installing OS and setup Network For the following set of posts, I have chosen to use VirtualBox to run through how to use ZFS in building your FileSystem. The first step is downloading and installing OpenIndiana. Get the latest build from http://openindiana.</description></item></channel></rss>
