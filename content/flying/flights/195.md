Dave Oddy was sponsor.  Fantastic 50 minute flight, Dave mentioned that if we punch out and down a bit, the ridges near the horses trail (trail switching back) are good for some lift.  I found a tiny bit there before landing and managed to sustain my flight for a fair bit.  I'm fairly proud of this.  I feel I may have flown when others landed due to having more of a risk tollerance when ridge soaring.  This may be a dangerous thing though that I'll need to keep evaluating.","location":"Mission","flightNumber":195,"type":"flightlog","flying-location":"Mission"}
