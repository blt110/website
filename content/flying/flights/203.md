Much like a previous trip flying cove where I could have benched back if I had the time.  Alex decided to head back as we were losing light, so this ended up being a good call.  Finished packing up at night fall.  Loved this flight, easy lift, amazing.  until the end, lift seemed more ridge lift","location":"Monroe","flightNumber":203,"type":"flightlog","flying-location":"Monroe"}
