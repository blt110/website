Made it from Monroe peak, to Cove mountain.  Had a bit of a low save off Monroe, not finding lift off the bat.  I couldn't seem to work Cove back up to the mountain and took a 40% colapse during flight, which made me want to land.  Looking at the track logs, I feel I may have left a thermal to go searching for stronger lift when I should have stuck with it more.  Fantastic flight","location":"Monroe","flightNumber":210,"type":"flightlog","flying-location":"Monroe"}
