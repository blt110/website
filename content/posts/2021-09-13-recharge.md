After working at Facebook for 5 years, we get to have a recharge. (think of it long service leave).  4 weeks of break which I added 1 week of PTO with.


## Day 1 (Saturday 11)
Today was an absolutely amazing Paragliding fly day.

## Day 2 (Sunday 12)
Bit of a headache.  Slept in a bit.  Decided to start planning my trip to hopefully catch up with Cooper on the way towards SLC.  Spend the night near a national park, perhaps spend the following day there before ending up at SLC on the Wednesday (before my flying day on Friday)

Caught up with Palak and Smiral for dinner, mostly talked food and eating.  Exciting about doing a cooking day with them both.  Seems that we're sharing a new hobby of gardening now.

On the note of gardening, I started looking into hydroponics a bit more.  I found a video saying airoponics was having better root systems, then discovered you can use fog, and went down a rabbit hole of reading about using Piezo's to resenate water at a point to produce fog.  I think I'll go with Hoocho's method of a Dutch bucket system and try and have that all setup by Janurary to start tomato growing.
