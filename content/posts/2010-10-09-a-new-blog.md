  Hello everyone. Ok, so this is a brand new blog. What happened to all my old content? I&#8217;d like to say I just wanted to start fresh, but truth is, I was lazy and didn&#8217;t back up any data from my hosting company before my term ended with them.. so I lost my database and content. I&#8217;ll re-post the good stuff, hopefully more in-depth on this site though. Stay tuned.
</p>

  This blog is going to be a lot more personal then my last. It&#8217;s going to have technical and personal posts where I&#8217;ll post about anything and everything that takes my fancy. Good times ðŸ™‚
