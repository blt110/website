My partner and I recently started renting an old place in Palo Alto.  With COVID, we've been working from home for almost two years now, and sharing a desk at times things felt a little cramped (especially with the occsional electronics project).

I'm no expert in woodwork, so decided to 3D model it before building the desk.  This also helped as my father, who's a carpenter, could give me tips when I shared my shared screen with him (being on other sides of the planet).  I'm pretty happy with how the [design](/posts/custom-desk/design.pdf) came out for this one.

Only thing I'd change if I were to do it again is the supporting plywood on each side.  If I had made them longer than the main surface, it could have also been used to support the side returns.  The frame is designed to butt up against the wall on each side to hold the desk steady.  The two support beams are then bolted together to hold it firmly.
