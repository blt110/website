  More blogging to come. I saw a movie last night with Rebecca and one of her friends Kat. It was pretty good, we got to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);">Mark Zuckerberg</a>&#8216;s portrayal in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.imdb.com']);">The Social Network</a>.

  It has made me realise a few things though. I mean, this guy is using open source tools to create some amazing things. I don&#8217;t code half as much as I&#8217;d like to any more.. this is going to change. I have never used emacs before.. This is going to change. I need a new computer, that&#8217;s the truth and that&#8217;s pretty much it for now
