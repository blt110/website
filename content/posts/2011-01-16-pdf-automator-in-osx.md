  As you may have been aware from my previous blog posts, I&#8217;ve been trying to make my life digital, that means any papers I get, I scan and file on a FileServer (with remote backups, etc, etc).
</p>

<p style="clear: both;">
  My scanner at home has a document feeder on it. The problem is that it doesn&#8217;t do duplex, only a set of sides. So far, I can scan one side of the document, flip the paper of, then scan the back pages. This will result two PDF&#8217;s with two sets of pages<br /> Set A: 1,3,5,7<br /> SET B: 8,6,4,2
</p>

<p style="clear: both;">
  To merge the two, I could open them both up in Adobe PDF, Preview and start clicking and dragging my time away, but that&#8217;s pointless. I&#8217;d like to introduce you to Automator in OSX.

After that, I&#8217;ll have a nice merged.pdf file on my desktop that&#8217;s the resulting page.

  (the shell script uses pdftk to make a /tmp/2.pdf file that&#8217;s a set 2,4,6,8. Copies the Set A to /tmp/1.pdf and then pipes it through some pdf tools built into OSX to merge the sets into 1,2,3,4.. etc

  Who needs to spend lots of money on a duplex scanner hey?
