So with my new job I&#8217;ve finally got some time to start playing.  One of the big things I&#8217;d like to improve here is information.  At the moment a lot of our information is kept in spreadsheets and the like in sharepoint.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with Sharepoint or spreadsheets, it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve found that these lead to more mistakes being made and when technitions are in a rush, they tend not to update the manual documentation.  I&#8217;ve decided to start trying to tackle information on our network by systematically polling the network devices and having self updating documentation.
