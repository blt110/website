In this post, I&#8217;ll be walking you through how to set up your switches to support a highly available switched environment for your computers to sit.

For my setup, I chose the <a href="http://www.juniper.net/in/en/products-services/switching/ex-series/ex2200/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.juniper.net']);">Juniper EX2200</a>.  These are a pretty safe bet of switch you are able to monitor with SNMP to see the bandwidth limitations in your network and the like, run multiple VLAN&#8217;s, but that&#8217;s a whole another story.  Ideally, if you&#8217;ve got the money to throw at it, you&#8217;d want to go for a switch that can be &#8216;stacked&#8217; (cisco term, Virtual chassis in the Juniper world, like the EX4200.)

With the EX4200&#8217;s or something similar, you&#8217;d have the ability to use your multiple NIC&#8217;s on your servers for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);">Link Aggregation</a> (to increase the throughput and availability of network connections across multiple links).  Because of the price, and our needs not requiring any more then gigabit ethernet, we&#8217;ll make sure to set up our NIC&#8217;s in an active/passive configuration.  For example, eth0 on a linux box would go to SWITCH1 and eth1 would go to SWITCH2.  Try to keep all your active links on the same switch to try and avoid too much data going over our backbone between the switches.

<a href="http://www.scottyob.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Switch-HA.jpg" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.scottyob.com']);"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-124" title="Switch HA" src="http://www.scottyob.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Switch-HA.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="229" /></a>

To keep things on the cheap, I&#8217;ve chosen to do Link Aggregation across 4 ethernet ports to the switches.  This will allow 4Gbit/s of bandwidth, which is more then enough should one or two NIC&#8217;s die on Switch1 and require to traverse this backbone (or for other services, like iLO and the like)

I used ports 20-24 on the switch to create the aggregate link, so my switch config looked like this in the end

`<br />
ge-0/0/20 {<br />
        ether-options {<br />
            802.3ad ae0;<br />
        }<br />
    }<br />
    ge-0/0/21 {<br />
        ether-options {<br />
            802.3ad ae0;<br />
        }<br />
    }<br />
    ge-0/0/22 {<br />
        ether-options {<br />
            802.3ad ae0;<br />
        }<br />
    }<br />
    ge-0/0/23 {<br />
        ether-options {<br />
            802.3ad ae0;<br />
        }<br />
    }<br />
    ae0 {<br />
        unit 0 {<br />
            family ethernet-switching {<br />
                port-mode trunk;<br />
            }<br />
        }<br />
    }</p>
