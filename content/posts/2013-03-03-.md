At work we&#8217;re currently evaluating a few load balancer and new network firewall designs.  This guide is how I set up a lab to load balance using F5&#8217;s with Policy Based Routing (PBR), as known as Filter Based Forwarding on the Juniper SRX series of firewalls.

## Problem

We want to introduce a load balancer into our network.  We want to ensure that only traffic that needs to will pass through this load balancer.  Effectively this is a one-armed configuration with filter based forwarding on the SRX100 in my lab to ensure all L3 information in the packets are kept in-tact.

## Environment

<a href="http://www.scottyob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Untitled-1.jpg" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.scottyob.com']);"><img class="size-medium wp-image-322 alignleft" alt="F5 PBR Schema" src="http://www.scottyob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Untitled-1-300x112.jpg" width="300" height="112" srcset="http://www.scottyob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Untitled-1-300x112.jpg 300w, http://www.scottyob.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Untitled-1.jpg 672w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> This lab is made up of an SRX100 being the gateway for subnets where the web cluster, The F5&#8217;s and acts as a firewall for external hosts in userland accessing our data centre resources.  On a simplified view, there are generally two common ways I&#8217;ve found to set up these load balancers.  You can either place the LB as the gateway for your servers behind it, meaning L3 IP information is kept in-tact, but any data traversing to/from these servers must be routed through the load balancers, or you can use SNAT; That is, once traffic hits the load balancer, a new connection is made from the LB, replacing the original source IP address with one of the LB.  This works fine, but destroys your L3 IP information and seems to be frowned upon by our groups who are pedantic about logging and what not.

If we leave the gateway settings as they are, then change our F5 iApp to say that yes, the the backend HTTP servers have a route back to the F5 instance, when the F5 receives a request on it&#8217;s VIP (lets say 1.1.1.10 in this case), it&#8217;ll change the destination IP address to that of the server (in this instance 1.2.3.4), then we&#8217;ll see the traffic getting routed back to the client but not being from the VIP&#8217;s address

```# curl http://1.1.1.10

16:33:34.056274 IP 1.2.3.4.http &gt; 10.69.69.10.51671: Flags [S.], seq 1769738684, ack 2029236993, win 14480, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 6764238 ecr 784149622,nop,wscale 6], length 0
```

not ideal..
