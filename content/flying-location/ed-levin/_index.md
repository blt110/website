[Ed Levin](https://parks.sccgov.org/santa-clara-county-parks/ed-r-levin-county-park) is a county park in Santa Clara, California.  This will always have a special place in my heart, being the location I learned to fly back in 2018 with [Lift Paragliding](http://liftparagliding.com/).

It's rather special to see how the site changes over the year, from a luscious green site over the rainy season, to a golden yellow throughout the rest of the year.

The site is often known as "Sled Heaven".  It is only recently that I'm feeling comfortable with later launches to work on increasing my flight time, and then the site doesn't work with too much of a north component in it.

The site is ran by [Wings of Rogallo](https://wingsofrogallo.org/ed-levin/), and provides a few different launches:
- Bunnny slope 50' training hill
- 300' launch
- 600' launch
- 1750' "top" launch

My goals for this site are:
- Ed to Mission
- Ed to Mission and Back
