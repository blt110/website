So lately I&#8217;ve been thinking about my backup strategy on my Mac. From previous posts you might know I&#8217;ve build my OpenIndiana ZFS FileServer. Well, just created a volume and decided to put 300GB to good use to create a time machine on my mac. There is a brilliant guide on how to do it <a href="http://marcoschuh.de/wp/?p=494" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://marcoschuh.de']);">here</a> and suggest you all take a look (Thanks for the awesome guide Marco).
