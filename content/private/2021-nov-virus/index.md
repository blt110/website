Night of the 16th:

* Start developing headaches, chills and muscle soreness
* Lots and lots of sleep as body felt exhausted
* Cleared up, felt good for the weekend

Tuesday 23:

* Started with coughs and lots of phlegm in lungs
* Lots of exhaustion, coughing and sleep right through to 27th.  Covid test returned negative result

Saturday 27th:

* Started throat soreness after coughing a bit, assumed I had torn my throat
* Noticed it was worse the next morning and has been getting progressively worse since.  Tonsillitis as white markings on tonsils
* Tongue also feels a bit swollen with what I think must be a few ulcers on the back of my tongue, making eating, drinking and conversing difficult.
* Strep test returned negative result

Tuesday 30th:
- Barely got any sleep last night, was finding it hard to stay asleep with the pain.  Was like a zombie for the day
- Have worked out a lot of my mouth pain is coming from developing ulcers on my tongue.  An ice block seems to be able to sooth them.
- Night was my best night yet, perhaps it was the 2x ibuprofen, but the swelling in my tongue was down, I could talk normally, and drink a water bottle without too much pain

Wednesday 1st:
- Believe I'm slowly on the mend.  Didn't sleep long stints because of congestion, snoring, and sore throat, which is a bit more inflamed than last night now
- Things of concern is a feeling of "pressure" in my right inner ear, and right teeth.  Perhaps an early sign of infection in sinuses?  Something to keep an eye on.

Questions:

* Other than the usual sleep, there’s nothing I ca do to speed this recovery up?
* Is it concerning to not get over it after the first few days assuming it’s all the same virus, but have this drag on for weeks in waves?  Should I be getting blood work and checking levels or something?
