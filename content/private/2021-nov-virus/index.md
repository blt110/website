Night of the 16th:

* Start developing headaches, chills and muscle soreness
* Lots and lots of sleep as body felt exhausted
* Cleared up, felt good for the weekend

Tuesday 23:

* Started with coughs and lots of phlegm in lungs
* Lots of exhaustion, coughing and sleep right through to 27th.  Covid test returned negative result

Saturday 27th:

* Started throat soreness after coughing a bit, assumed I had torn my throat
* Noticed it was worse the next morning and has been getting progressively worse since.  Tonsillitis as white markings on tonsils
* Tongue also feels a bit swollen with what I think must be a few ulcers on the back of my tongue, making eating, drinking and conversing difficult.
* Strep test returned negative result

Tuesday 30th:
- Barely got any sleep last night, was finding it hard to stay asleep with the pain.  Was like a zombie for the day
- Have worked out a lot of my mouth pain is coming from developing ulcers on my tongue.  An ice block seems to be able to sooth them.
- Night was my best night yet, perhaps it was the 2x ibuprofen, but the swelling in my tongue was down, I could talk normally, and drink a water bottle without too much pain

Wednesday 1st:
- Believe I'm slowly on the mend.  Didn't sleep long stints because of congestion, snoring, and sore throat, which is a bit more inflamed than last night now
- Things of concern is a feeling of "pressure" in my right inner ear, and right teeth.  Perhaps an early sign of infection in sinuses?  Something to keep an eye on.

Thursday 2nd:
- Scary day, didn't sleep much on the wednesday night, but the swelling has spread so much that it feels bruised all on the right hand side of my face.  There's more swelling in the mouth right up around my gums and teeth, and I'm unable to open my mouth very wide, talking is hard, and I need to keep a close eye on this in case the swelling continues
- Amazing how much it went down with some ibuprofen
- Started course of Antibiotics as suggested by doctor, if it's not going away on its own, we might as well give this a go.

Friday 3rd:
- Had a much better nights sleep, not much coughing or things to keep me up
- Woke up with what I think is reduced swelling
- It looks like the white areas around my tonsils are slowly going away.
Drugs:
- 8:30 both ibuprofen & antibiotics

Questions:
* Other than the usual sleep, there’s nothing I ca do to speed this recovery up?
* Is it concerning to not get over it after the first few days assuming it’s all the same virus, but have this drag on for weeks in waves?  Should I be getting blood work and checking levels or something?
