      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve not been writing or blogging for some time. Over half a decade. It has been about 12 years since I started this blog, and a lot has changed since then. I&amp;rsquo;ve not found the time to document my tinkerings and projects as work has taken most of my time. I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave work related things on Linkedin, personal posts on Facebook, but I would like to continue using this site as my partner tends to use her diaries, as a way looking back at what I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with.</description>
