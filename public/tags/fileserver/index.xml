      <description>Note: This post is one in a series aimed to be a tutorial eventually, it’s not currently finalised and at the moment exists as a place for collating thought and collecting feedback

Setting up the FileSystems is a trivial task. First, you can see that when we’ve created a storage pool ‘datastore’ it created a filesystem for us (also called datastore) that can act as a container for child file systems.</description>

Installing OS and setup Network For the following set of posts, I have chosen to use VirtualBox to run through how to use ZFS in building your FileSystem. The first step is downloading and installing OpenIndiana. Get the latest build from http://openindiana.</description>

      <description>so I&amp;#8217;ve moved back home with the family now. One thing I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to do is to digitise my life and get set up on the cloud. I think it&amp;#8217;ll be really basic to start off with. VPN access in to my home network, firewall everything off, then create a few layers of the network. The issue is that I want to go paperless. I want to set up a ZFS Fileserver to store and snapshot all my data with remote encrypted backups of important documents and the like.</description>
