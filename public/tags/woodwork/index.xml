      <description>My partner and I recently started renting an old place in Palo Alto. With COVID, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working from home for almost two years now, and sharing a desk at times things felt a little cramped (especially with the occsional electronics project).
I&amp;rsquo;m no expert in woodwork, so decided to 3D model it before building the desk. This also helped as my father, who&amp;rsquo;s a carpenter, could then give me tips when I shared my computer screen with him (being on other sides of the planet).</description>
