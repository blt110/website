      <description>I’ve never found a really simple video on what exactly Anycast is with a basic examples when exploring the concepts. I decided to lab it up and figured this might help some of you starting out with the concepts. Any comments feel free to let me know!

      <description>Introduction In one of my last little tasks at work, I was asked to eliminate single points of failure in the software and hardware stack without spending a fortune on hardware or software licenses.
