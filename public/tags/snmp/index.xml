      <description>Just finishing off a few things at work this week. We’ve got a few sites around the place where we have HA internet powered by two Juniper SRX100’s. The Two SRX100’s operate in a Chassis Cluster and peer with our ISP using BGP across both active/passive devices.
Below is a little Nagios check script that I wrote to hook into our in-house Nagios monitoring platform. It makes sure the chassis cluster has not failed over operating in a degraded state, and makes sure that there are two BGP peers connected.</description>
